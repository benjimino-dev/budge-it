# budge-it
A project built to learn MVC architecture, Budge-It is a frontend application that allows users to input various incomes/expenses and check their budget.

GOALS
-----
This project was built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS/SASS and HTML5.

I built this project to better familiarise myself with the popular Model View Controller architecture. I also wanted to ensure that I could build a scaleable frontend without using a framework such as React.
